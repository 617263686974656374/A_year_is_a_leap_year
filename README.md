# A_year_is_a_leap_year
This Java program is designed to identify and list leap years within a user-defined range. Upon execution, it prompts the user to input a starting and an ending year, ensuring via validation checks that these inputs are integers. The program then sequentially evaluates each year within this range based on the standard leap year criteria: a year is considered a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400. For every year in the specified interval, the program outputs a message indicating whether that year is a leap year or not, providing a clear, year-by-year breakdown of leap years within the user-defined timeframe.
